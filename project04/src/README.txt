Project 4

Option: local

invocation:
./compfs <filename.fs>

This program incorporates all the previous project to createa .asm file. Please note that there are a lot of changes made to this and I still cannot lock down all the contexts.

NOTE:
Initially I've tried using queues instead of set since set auto sorts, but since queues has minimal interface and I need
the option for traversal, I've used deque instead.
