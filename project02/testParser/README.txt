Project 2

invocation:
./frontEnd <filename.fs>

This program will incorporate the scanner and use its tokens to produce a parse tree. This parse tree will be LL
and will print as such when the program finishes running.

NOTE:
I've thoroughly tested all the good program files 1-8. It parses all of them out.

Please test each program 1 at a time, as this was how I tested it when I ran each of the files.
